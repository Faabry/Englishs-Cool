<h1>English's Cool</h1>
<p>This is my English school which was founded for me a few years ago, where I'm do one of the things that I like most, teach, and as I'm changing to the technology area I decided to increase my English's shcool to another level, by creating a plataform where my students will have a lot of different applications like games, translators and much more, I hopo you enjoy it.</p>

<p>At this game we will basically make a sentence with a randomly word based on the user's cateroy chosen, with a randomly verb, by doing this the student can improve his vocabulary because in some situations he'll need to use his creativity to create a sentence that makes sence.</p>
